# Pedro Pathing Visualizer

Big Thanks to #16166 Watt's Up for developing this, we really appreciate your work.

Big thanks to Matthew Allen for his contributions to the [Pedro Pathing Visualizer](https://github.com/Mallen220/PedroPathingVisualizer), where the original code was heavily refactored and expanded with many new features that were later reintegrated here.
